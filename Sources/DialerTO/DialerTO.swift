    /// - Amounts over 5,000,001: Fee of 5,000
    /// - Amounts between 2,000,001 and 5,000,000: Fee of 3,000
    /// - Amounts between 150,001 and 2,000,000: Fee of 1,500
    /// - Amounts between 10,001 and 150,000: Fee of 250
    /// - Amounts between 1,001 and 10,000: Fee of 100
    /// - Amounts between 1 and 1,000: Fee of 20
    /// - Amounts outside these ranges: Returns nil (invalid transaction)
    ///
    /// - Parameter amount: The transaction amount to calculate the fee for
    /// - Returns: The fee for the transaction, or nil if the amount is invalid
    ///
    /// # Examples:
    /// ```swift
    /// TransactionOptimizer.calculateFee(for: 5_000) // Returns 100
    /// TransactionOptimizer.calculateFee(for: 100_000) // Returns 250
    /// TransactionOptimizer.calculateFee(for: 250_000) // Returns 1,500
    /// TransactionOptimizer.calculateFee(for: 10_000_001) // Returns nil
